.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is an open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile and desktop applications. It is the evolution of Xamarin.Forms and is designed to create native user interfaces that can run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and more.

.NET MAUI allows developers to write a single codebase using C# and XAML, and deploy their applications to various platforms without sacrificing native performance and user experience. It provides a rich set of controls, layouts, and services that can be used to create responsive and visually appealing applications.
